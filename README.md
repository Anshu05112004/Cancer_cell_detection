# Cancer_cell_detection
## Brief
This notebook demonstrates how to use machine learning to classify two types of cancer patients based on features given. The features are derived from the  Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from kaggle, which contains 698 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
## NOTEBOOK CONTENT
The notebook consists of the following steps:

* Importing the necessary libraries and modules
* Loading and exploring the data
* Splitting the data into training and testing sets
* Building and training a logistic regression model
* Evaluating the model performance on the test set
* Visualizing the model coefficients and the decision boundary
  ## Libraries used
  The notebook requires the following libraries and modules:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
